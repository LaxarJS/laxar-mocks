# LaxarJS Testing [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LaxarJS/laxar-testing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LaxarJS/laxar-testing)

> The companion testing framework for LaxarJS widgets.

Use it on top of Jasmine to setup and load a widget just like in a real app.
The available APIs then support you in instrumenting and inspecting the widget under test.

For an introduction to *LaxarJS Testing* have a look at the [manuals](docs/manuals/index.md).
Additionally the [API docs](docs/api/laxar-testing.js.md) provide detailed information on the configuration, instrumentation and inspection possibilities.
